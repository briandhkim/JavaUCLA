this was further exploration of the plotting portion from ArrayMathStatic.
Here, the goal was to create a plot that could be updated in response to axis changes and color changes for the plotted line.
Additionally, an attempt was made to implement drag/drop and zoom in/out features.

The drag/drop and zoom in/out features have not been perfected.
